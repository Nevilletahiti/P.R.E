                Young Dolph goes verse for verse with Megan Thee Stallion for his new single <i>RNB</i>.<br/>
                Produced by Juicy J, the track also comes with an animated visualizer video you can watch below.<br/> 
                At the beginning of March 2020, Dolph announced he was retiring from music to "kick it" with his son.<br/>
                Weeks later, the Memphis rapper returned to social media to announce his forthcoming album, writing, <b>"My son jus told me I can't be his dad if I stop putting out music."</b><br/>
                On March 20th 2020, he teased that the project would hit streaming services that night.<br/>
                The release was Dolph's first full-length since 2019's Dum and Dummer with Key Glock, and his first solo release since 2018's Role Model.

                This new album feels like a culmination of this career. The 78-minute runtime is intimidating, but it means we get to spend more time with Dolph and his compelling roster of personalities.<br/>
                On opener "Talking to My Scale," Dolph starts with a motivated Tupac-on-lean monologue about the fakeness of your enemies and "running it up to the motherfuckin ceiling."<br/>
                Then asks an earnest question: "If I sacrifice myself, will I go to Hell?" It’s Dolph’s gift to casually let you into his life like this, using first-person anecdotes that detail his rise to the top.<br/>
                Glock, his most direct descendant, has a similar knack for storytelling, and he displays it on “Mister Glock 2.<br/>
